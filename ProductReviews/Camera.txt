Kodak DC290 2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom	13-AUG-14	5	"IF YOU CAN FIND ONE BUY IT! GREATEST DIGITAL W FLAWLESS PHOTOS MADE!"	You are looking at one of Kodak's finer digital cameras.. Because this was the beginning of the "mp" where more was not necessarily better.. I recall the craze when everyone kept demanding higher mp! I personally wouldnt trade my 2mp camera for the big 10mp anyday!. This camera, if you can find one as no one who has one is willing to part with it as it still to this day takes crisper cleaner better focused pictures than the digital cameras today.. MY RECOMMENDATION:BEST DIGITAL PRO CAMERAS OUT THERE!. MY RATING: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++. **be sure to check all my 100% honest accurate reviews!**
Olympus D-360L 1.3 MP Digital Camera	15-JUL-14	4	and make them as big as I like. then I put them on DVD to make ...	I had just purchased my  third Olympus one D340 R and two D360L the pace I put these cameras through , surprised me how long they lasted. the only trouble I had with the other too is a flimsily battery door latch, both finally gave way and I had to make my own door latch ;. I am reading  reviews on here and all state there is no zoom. the camera has one zoom on it, you hit the + and you get a zoom in on your subject. hit - and it moves to a farther out view. but with my Kodak reader I can transfer my pictures to my PC, and make them as big as I like. then I put them on DVD to make a slide show. for the money you can't beat the camera, just wish Olympus would beef up there battery door latch. The D360R I have now still works but had to make  my own latch to hold the batteries in. over all I would give it 4 and a half stars, better latch for the battery door would be a 5 star.
Kodak DC3400 2MP Digital Camera with 2x Optical Zoom	18-JUL-14	4	I liked my original camera	Bought it as an exact replacement for my camera that was stolen when my car was broken into.  It is indeed an exact replacement.  I liked my original camera, that's why I bought this one, and it did not disappoint me.

Olympus Camedia Brio D-150 1.3MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom	14-JUL-14	1	The product is a disaster. It arrived without any ...	The product is a disaster.  It arrived without any instructions (which I was finally able to locate online) or cable.  It has no internal memory and requires an SD card.  I loaded a card into the camera. and that's the last I've seen of it.  Contrary to the instruction on the camera "Press to eject," the card is in the camera and cannot be retrieved.  In order to get the card back (it already had some pics on it), I will need to now destroy the camera.  Will not purchase from this vendor again.

When I received it, the package was in perfect condition. When I opened it, the body itself was cracked and there was a huge dent in the corner of the camera, obviously from either being thrown or dropped from height. On the good it does work.

Olympus C60 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	21-JUL-14	5	This thing was awesome ten years ago.	Oh heavens.  I bought this thing in 2005 while I was deployed to replace a 3MP camera I had at the time.  It served extremely admirably, allowing for some excellent photos to be taken while overseas.

OLYMPUS Camedia C-725 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera	05-AUG-14	1	The camera took some good pictures, but the disc to download the camera ...	I have had the camera for 4 or 5 months, but it is nearly worthless to me. The camera took some good pictures, but the disc to download the camera to the computer is next to worthless. The instructions are long and tedious, which has discouraged me from trying to download pictures. My advice is to purchase from another buyer!

Canon Powershot A520 4MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom	17-JUL-14	5	One of the best out there	I purchased this Camera as a backup and I find I am using it more than my other Camera's because the pictures are so bright and the video's are out of this world.  Canon is a great brand and nothing beats their quality.  I have more expensive Camera's and they did not come close when it comes to the sharpness.  I did not need a manual to operate because the dial is so easy to use.

Thanks Bob for the super fast shipping and the bonus card! We really appreciate it.
Sony Cybershot DSCS60 4.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	23-JUL-14	4	For everyday pictures this is a Reasonable camera for the money.	Takes very decent Pictures for daylight and night at short distance.  For everyday use.this is not a pro camera, but will last for some years. Well built. very reasonable for the money. Does not feel cheap or plastic in your hand.. Because of low MP, not recommended for printing, but nowdays few people print the pictures. so it will suit. those who just want to take family, friends, pets, house etc. everyday pictures.
Konica Minolta Dimage E500 5MP Digital Camera 3x Optical Zoom	26-JUL-14	4	Hungry camera wants more batteries	Good camera, but eats through normal alkaline batteries like I do with potato chips.  If you get this camera, get those rechargeable high capacitance batteries.

The camera was in good shape but to my surprise it was so out dated that I could not find any store that carried a memory card that would fit this camera. I'm glad I only spent $19.00 because it sits in a drawer now..  now.
Kodak Easyshare C533 5 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom	30-JUL-14	5	Still Going Strong! Decent and Reliable Back-Up Camera	I had to post this even though the camera is a very old model. It's a testament to the build quality of Kodaks that this little camera is still working after getting a lot of constant use over the years. Its 3X zoom is decent enough for product shots as long as you use a tripod and have plenty of light on the subject. For good sharp pics use the macro setting and get in close. Otherwise it's a decent point and shoot camera, a good spare to pack on trips with a 4-pack of AA batteries.
Sony Cybershot DSCW50 6MP Digital Camera with  3x Optical Zoom	30-JUL-14	5	Excellent camera.	I believe I don't have to explain too much.Excellent camera.

I have used the Canon A540 for the past six years and have been well satisfied with its performance.
Canon PowerShot A530 5MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom	19-JUL-14	5	A Photo Work Horse	What an amazing product.  I don't think you can break this thing. It just keeps going and going and going.  It takes clearer pictures than things far newer and more expensive.
Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	23-JUL-14	5	Long lasting and compact camera	I have had this camera for nearly 8 years and it is still going strong. It takes pretty good pictures and fits in your pocket. I would be happy to keep it for many more years!

Sony Cybershot DSC-H2 6MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilization Zoom	17-JUL-14	5	but it's still a great camera. Lightweight yet fully featured	By now this is an obsolete piece of equipment, but it's still a great camera. Lightweight yet fully featured, it's lacking only an interchangeable lens to make it a completely professional camera. If you're trying for gallery quality prints you'll be limited to 8x10s.
Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 7.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilization Zoom	16-JUL-14	2	Shutter button broke	Great camera, however the shutter button is plastic and broke.  Fixing it is over $200.

Canon PowerShot A640 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom	10-AUG-14	5	Still going strong 8 years later	I bought this camera 8 years ago and wanted to post a quick update on its reliability atter 8 years of use for those of you interested in picking one up in used condition.  This still works great!  It's a nice, fully featured, affordable camera with decent specs (at the time).  I used it extensively for three years, then it was passed on to my wife and then our son.  It's taken abuse from three different people but all mechanicals are in proper working order and there has been no degradation in photo quality.  Hope this helps!
Kodak Easyshare C433 4 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom	02-AUG-14	5	Five Stars	Good product, very pleased. Would buy from this seller again.
Olympus Stylus 750 7.1MP Digital Camera with Digital Image Stabilized 5x Optical Zoom and CCD Shift Stabilization	26-JUL-14	2	Not super durable, also, does anyone without a cell phone still use these?	I've owned a number of point-and-shoots and I've found that Olympus has not been one of the stronger contestants. This camera met a premature demise after the front diagonal shutter over the lens stopped working and became stuck half-shut. Yes, I could have had it repaired, but it just wasn't worth it for this point-and-shoot.. If I'm honest, the camera on my S3 is faster and quality is pretty comparable.
Fujifilm Finepix Z5fd 6.3MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)	15-JUL-14	5	Great easy camera	Bought this for my son when he was in college.  He loved it.

HP Photosmart R837 7MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	13-AUG-14	1	Price Too High	This price is way off.  I bought this camera new many years ago in Walmart for less than $90.  I am looking for a replacement because I dropped mine several times and no longer works.  I love the camera but I wouldn't pay this price in a million years.
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom	13-JUL-14	5	Five Stars	new in the box.

Casio Exilim EXZ75 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Anti Shake Optical Zoom (Silver)	09-AUG-14	1	Big disappointment. Seller said	Big disappointment. Seller said, per ad, that the camera was used but worked fine.  It would not work at all. I have one just like it , and want a back up, so I have all the stuff to make it work. Sent it back for a refund. I guess I will review your offers again and try to pick someone that appears to not be selling junk. Looks like they would test it before sending to avoid all this.
Canon PowerShot A570IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom	06-AUG-14	5	Damage control	This purchase replaces the same model camera that was ran over by a vehicle on a Eastern Oregon camping trip and damaged beyond use.  I liked the previous A570IS so well, that I wanted another of the same model.  It has all of the bells and whistles that I want and need, and is the perfect mate to my camera usage.
Canon PowerShot TX1 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom	05-AUG-14	5	7 Years and still going strong!	I have owned this camera for over 7 years now and it has never let me down. Back in 2007, you didn't have a lot of options for hybrid camera/video recorder. There were a couple, but the megapixels were low or it had slow shutter speed. I was very lucky though, at CES in 2006 Canon came out with the TX1.. Here is the killer features folks, Optical Zoom and 720P. This baby has 10x Optical Zoom. Which was huge back then for a hybrid. In addition it has 7.1MP and records in 720P. The lens tucks itself back in and has a little shutter and its all automatic. Even has a standby power program in case you left it running. Software wise it works very well, easy to navigate the LCD. Finally, when your all done it can fit in your pocket. The camera is a little larger than a pack of cigarettes or playing cards, whichever you prefer.. The only drawback to all that glory is storage. At the time I had to keep a laptop nearby to offload video and pictures each day. Even though I was using two 8GB SDHC cards. When recording video, it literally ate through 1GB or so every 15 min.. Flash forward to 2014 and my TX1 has gone to many places. Multiple States, Australia, and recently South Africa on Safari.
Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	11-AUG-14	5	Love this camera!	This little gem takes great picture and video. After years of usage, it's still working great. I paid $150+ for it.  so worth it!

Fujifilm Finepix S700 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom	03-AUG-14	5	This is an awesome camera. Still working well today ...	This is an awesome camera. Still working well today many years later only a bit outdated with technology. However, it still is working well after thousands of pictures.
INTOVA INWD-IC600 6.0 Megapixel Digital Camera with Waterproof Housing -180FT	22-JUL-14	1	Intova customer support were pretty unhelpful - the most they'd offer was a 10% ...	leaked from nearly day one when I bought it maybe four years ago.  Maybe OK if you only stay on the surface, but as soon as you dive down (I'm only snorkelling, so no more than 30 ft), it leaks.. Intova customer support were pretty unhelpful - the most they'd offer was a 10% discount on a newer model.  I will replace with a unit from sealife; not buy from Intova again. Shame, because otherwise it would have been adequate for the price.
VuPoint DC-ST531TBLK-VP - Digital camera - compact - 5.0 Mpix / 12 Mpix (interpolated) - supported memory: MMC, SD	30-JUL-14	3	camera feels cheap and easily broken- we shall see and I will adjust rating ...	Have not used this camera yet- just received it yesterday , however on first inspection, camera feels cheap and easily broken- we shall see and I will adjust rating but very disappointed that I purchased a 16 gb said card only to find out that the camera is only capable of using a 2 gb said card!!!
Fujifilm FinePix AX650 16MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)	14-JUL-14	5	The ease of shooting on this is such that it has pretty much replaced all my oldies but goodies	Talk about moving into the 22nd century. A little extreme, you say. Well, I have a brownie box camera, a konica 2-1/4, a polaroid and a bunch of other cameras .  even a VHS camcorder. The ease of shooting on this is such that it has pretty much replaced all my oldies but goodies. I still save the Konica for special shots, but this is fast, easily editable, simple to print. Wow!
Fujifilm FinePix AX650 16MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)	23-JUL-14	5	Five Stars	excellent camera with lots of extras
Fujifilm FinePix AX650 16MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)	24-JUL-14	5	Worth every penny!	Nice little camera. I bought it to toss in the glove box, but I like it just about as much as my Nikon S9700.
Fujifilm FinePix AX650 16MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)	05-AUG-14	4	Quick focus, great carry size, easy to use...with case and 8GB SD Card	Great battery life. Two AAs lasted 2 1/2 vacation days of regular picture taking, zooming, etc. Seller shipped it with a case and an 8GB SD card! Easy picture taking and lots of stock styles to choose from. Low light is still a problem with a camera in this class of course. But great pictures can be taken with this camera for sure. Quick focus and easy to use. Great SR Auto modes, just like Fuji Film's Finepix version of the Coolpix. Can't beat this camera for vacation because of it's small size. It's a little thick, but very easy to slide in a pocket and snap with one hand.

Leica M8 10.3MP Digital Rangefinder Camera with .68x Viewfinder	25-JUL-14	5	Five Stars	it is really nice
Leica M8 10.3MP Digital Rangefinder Camera with .68x Viewfinder	28-JUL-14	5	Sometimes the greatest camera I've ever used!	If you've read anything about the Leica M8 on the internet you've undoubtedly heard about all of its "issues," so I won't bother going over them to any great extent, but I will add my thoughts on them.. The shutter is louder than a film Leica, no doubt about it, but it's not really loud either.  I'd agree with what some people have said about the shutter making a different kind of noise, but honestly it's as loud as pretty much any DSLR these days.  Of course, there are a couple of advantages to the noisier shutter in the M8 versus the quieter one in the M9, M8.2 and so-called M8.1, such as 1/8000th second top shutter speed and 1/250th flash sync.  In a professional-grade camera, I really appreciate the higher flash sync, so I'll put up with a slightly noisier--but not really noisy--shutter.. One thing that really bothers me:  why no PC-sync port?!  I know a lot of people say, "oh, well a M-rangefinder is about natural light shooting," but that's stupid.  Photography is about controlling light, whether it's existing or not, and sometimes I'd like to be able to plug some studio lights into the camera and still be able to use the shoe for additional viewfinders.  I can't believe the M9 still doesn't have a PC-sync port.. The camera itself is really rather unobtrusive--it's smallish and it looks like something you dug out of your grandpa's closet--unless someone happens to recognize it as a Leica.  It's sort of funny to watch people process why an "antique" camera like this has an LCD on the back, and inevitably they ask, "Is this digital?"  I've always wondered what they'd think if I said no.. I sort of have mixed feelings about removing the bottom plate to change the battery and the SD card, but it's not too much trouble; I know some people think it's a bother, but it is what it is.  Battery life is as you've heard: on the low side.  I usually take my M8 on vacation with me and I'm always careful to charge the battery every night; I'd like to just carry an extra battery pack, but they're stupidly pricey.  I'd guess about 400 shots to a charge when you're not doing a lot of image review.. It has a 1.33x crop factor compared to 35mm film, and that's a little annoying, but to me since it's a rangefinder and you're not actually looking through the lens it seems easier to me to adjust to than the 1.5x or 1.6x common to most DSLRs.  I would still appreciate a full frame sensor, but the M9, ME, and M Typ-240 are just more than I can honestly justify spending on a camera (and sometimes the M8 is as well).  I sold my Voigtlander Color-Skopar 35mm f/2.5 PII and replaced it with their Nokton Classic 35mm f/1.4 MC, and I'm fairly happy with it as a basic "normal" lens, and it wasn't too outrageously expensive.. The general conclusion on the internet is that the M8 is too noisy regarding higher ISO settings.  And I'd maybe agree, but while it's no D810 or 5D Mark III, it's also an improvement over many APS-C DSLRs out there.  Noise aside, I've worked with files from a lot of different cameras and the M8 files have a crispness that I haven't been able to find in other cameras, and I'd wager that the lack of any anti-alias filter in the camera is the reason.  I've compared the M8 against the Canon 7D, and I'd conclude that, in terms of resolution, the M8 is a match for the 7D.  A camera like the 5D Mark III has an advantage at large print sizes, but I think up to 11x14 or so the M8 is a strong contender.. IR/UV sensitivity is an issue, and the whole black-into-magenta thing shows up pretty easily.  Leica sent me two filters to block it, but even with coded lenses the whole cyan corner shift is still a bit of an issue at times.  I've coded my lenses with markers, but my Zeiss and Leica lenses rub off too easily.  Voigtlander lenses have a nice groove in the mount to prevent the self-coding from wearing off, but I tend to favor Zeiss lenses, and I find myself recoding them every four or five lens changes.  But having an infrared sensitive camera is actually pretty nice, and a simple Hoya R72 visible light blocking filter is all that's needed to take advantage of it.  The best thing is that unlike on an SLR, focusing (and metering even!) is as easy as ever.. I actually sold off nearly all of my Canon kit in order to purchase more M-mount lenses.  I thought I'd keep the Canon stuff for the things that a rangefinder isn't suitable for, but it turned out that for what I was shooting a rangefinder could do 90% of it.  One thing that turned out to be pretty neat was that when I put my Canon ST-E2 wireless controller on my M8, I found out that if I used the 580EX II Speedlights set in manual wireless mode I could fire them off with a maximum sync-speed of 1/90th second!  I just had to make sure that the M8 wasn't set to second curtain sync or it'd miss the flash, but I was surprised that this worked at all.  In the end though, the 580s were sold and I've picked up some Nikon SB-24s and SB-28s that work great with the M8.. Anyway,  I really like the M8, but it's not a camera for everyone, and there's times that I really miss having a DSLR.  Having such an anachronistic camera is always going to be a bit of a struggle unless you're either wealthy enough to not really care about it, or have a specific enough shooting style that you can make the most of it.  I wouldn't really say that I'm either of those things, but every now and then everything comes together correctly and the M8 is the greatest camera I've ever used.

I have had this camera for 6 years and I have never had an issue with it. The pictures are clear and it does great work. I am in no way a professional photographer just use it for basic pictures that are a little above average I would say.

Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom	11-AUG-14	4	Good Gig / Bad Death	We have had a wonderful experience with this camera and are sad to see it go. We started having problems simply opening it. We we get a "lens error" message. Looking around, online, I see that is supposedly associated with moisture, but we find it associated with age. That is to say, we simply got it more and more. Finally, it jammed up for good, while on vacation. Again, we got a lot of wonderful photos from it. But its death is very frustrating.
HP Photosmart M447 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	15-JUL-14	2	There are many better cameras on Amazon at a great price	This camera is so out dated. Only allows you to take 10 pictures. There are many better cameras on Amazon at a great price.

I got my camera like this almost 7 years ago and when it finally wore almost out I got a new camera, and gave this one to  my sister even though the window in the front had problems opening and sometimes wouldnt come on she used it for almost 2 years., I didnt like my new camera and went back to trying to find a photosmart like my first. it was impossible . then my sisters finally gave out and she wanted one just like this one. finding it on your sight was an answer to prayer. it was perfect good price and in wonderful condition. I wish I could find another one. you got it to me so fast also. thank you so  very much from the both of us. lillian sibley and nina fish.

HP Photosmart Slim R725 6.2MP 24X Zoom, 2'' LCD Digital Camera	08-AUG-14	5	FANTASTIC CAMERA	We just love this camera.  The pictures are fantastic.  We owned another of these cameras and unfortunately I dropped it in the water and had to order another one.  Again the pictures on the old camera were wonderful too.  So much so, that people always comment on them and want to know what camera we use.  We have an expensive Nikon camera but use this one the most.  It's handy, fits into your pocket, easy to use and no lens that comes out to worry about.  I would order this again in a jiffy should I need too.
Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H3 8.1 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom with Super SteadyShot Image Stabilization	31-JUL-14	5	very good	Probably outdated by now, but great camera. Completely satisfied. Does an excellent job. I bought it based on recommendation of Consumer Reports.
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18K 8.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)	24-JUL-14	4	This is a great first-dlr camera to own	This is a great first-dlr camera to own.  I knew nothing about photography when I first bought it and learned one thing after another till I was taking photos that looked like a pro took them.  I used the camera almost exclusively outdoors and have produced some striking photos.  My favorites are the American Toad, the White Peony and 'Poser' , a tree swallow that sat on a post and allowed me to photograph him.  I swear he was actually posing for the camera.  I replaced this with another camera only because I wanted more MP's.  The camera I bought has a longer 'lapse' between photos and it takes longer to focus, but maybe that's because I'm not well versed in it's usage to date.  I highly recommend this particular camera though.  You can get excellent results with it.

Kodak Easyshare Z812IS 8.2 MP Digital Camera with 12xOptical Image Stabilized Zoom	15-JUL-14	5	Perfect travel camera.	I carried this camera with me on motorcycle trips all over the country for 6 years.  I didn't have a single complaint about it.

The battery system is quite versatile, allowing you to use a rechargeable OR standard AA alkaline batteries.

Tried another brand, but I really like this one. It's why i searched for it again. Mine came used (just opened up), but I am having no problems with it.

Norcent DCC-725 7.0MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	22-JUL-14	4	hit or miss quality in the exact same model	It's really hit or miss with these cameras. My first one took the best quality photos ever. After it was stolen, I ordered this one, and I have not been able to replicate the same quality of photographs with it. It still takes good photos, but is not the PERFECT quality of the prior camera of the exact same model.
Kodak Easyshare C813 8.2 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom	25-JUL-14	5	I WIN !	My youngest son and daughter-in-law gave me a new Kodak Easyshare for Christmas several years ago.

I came to Amazon and found this used camera. Bargained priced, guaranteed good condition. What a good choice. It is a 5 star purchase from the lady selling it on Amazon. Thank you.

Sony Cybershot DSC-H10 8.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot	23-JUL-14	1	It didn't do it immediately and I'm pretty careful with camera equipment	The camera malfunctions now by imparting a purple haze to each shot. disappointing. It didn't do it immediately and I'm pretty careful with camera equipment. unfortunate
Sony Cybershot DSC-H10 8.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot	23-JUL-14	3	great except for low-light and indoor photography	I have had this camera for what, 7 years now? Actually this is my second one. Let's just say this camera is definitely not waterproof.. I have taken this camera to numerous events and trips. I would say its a pretty reliable camera, I've gotten some really awesome photos from it. I would recommend this camera to someone who wants a good, easy-to-use camera. Be aware however, that this camera has major strengths and weaknesses (continued below):. Strengths: macro (close up photography), vivid colors, flowers, daylight, outdoors. Weaknesses: any low-light situations (indoors and outdoors), dull colors (settings can be adjusted for cloudy days- this is a must if you get this camera, it will make your photos look so rich and amazing), high contrast (taking a photo against a bright window for example. this is universal problem for most cameras). So if you plan on getting some heavy use out of this camera in any time before sunrise or after sunset, be ready to be deeply disappointed. I've tried tripods, the self-timer setting, the twilight settings.  nothing works! They all come out horribly. Fuzzy, unflattering. just ugh.. Other than that. this camera is not too shabby. I have gotten some spectacular photos from it even though it is just a digital camera. It's a good size too, feels good in the hand, makes it easy to take steady shots. The shutter button is much better than the ones on most standard digital cameras, yet nowhere near as sensitive as the ones on dslr cameras.. This camera takes a micro-SD card, not your usual sd memory card. Unfortunately this means its more of a pain to find in stores and more expensive too (hint, hint- buy it online). It also means you can't just plug in your memory card into a computer/photo printer without the adapter (this usually comes with new micro-sd cards though).

Sony Cybershot DSCW150 8.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot	27-JUL-14	5	Great Companion If You Have Larger Cameras	I am not going to get into technical details as you can easily read this on this site. I purchased this came in 2008 and have been using it every week for the past 6 years. This is my "pocket" camera that I almost always drop it into my pocket when I leave home. It is not necessarily for making a lot of great photo shots, however it is great to catch those unusual photos in your day to day life. I like to review restaurants and critique and I always have this little camera handy. The quality of the photos have been improved greatly on the later models but this one is great for small photos that I post on the internet. I had one problem with the camera in six years. The memory card that I inserted had a small rough place on the bottom left and the card got stuck in the camera. I was about ready to toss it when I learned that I could remove the broken tip of the memory card by carefully using a wire and file. After about 15 minutes I was able to retrieve the broken tip of the card, insert a new card and the  camera is back to working full time. This is a very rugged little camera that is made of lightweight metal and not plastic like so many are today. Also there is a view finder. Try to find a similar model today with a viewfinder at a reasonable price. I just purchased s second one off of eBay that is  a different color. I also use that one too. This was a great buy for a really neat little camera. It is no substitute for my Nikons but is a companion for them.

Olympus Stylus Tough-8000 12 MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD	12-AUG-14	1	Not so "tough"	I bought this for my daughter when she was in Afghanistan. She wanted something heavy duty.  It did not hold up as promised. This was not cheap and did not hold up even for a year. The lens fogged over (it never got wet) She ended up throwing it away. It was not functional. Very disappointed.

Most people just go with their phones these days, but I love having my camera.

Fujifilm FinePix Z33WP 10 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	23-JUL-14	5	Five Stars	Four year and still a great camera!!!
Fujifilm FinePix Z33WP 10 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom	25-JUL-14	4	My favorite!	I've owned about 4 digital cameras in my life and this Fujifilm Finepix Z33WP was my favorite. (Granted they were all cheaper cameras.)  I broke my Canon camera at the beach (with barely any moisture or sand) and I broke my Nikon camera in a mosh pit so I looked for a waterproof camera with a stable, non retracting lens. This Z33WP was perfect! It went in the ocean with me many times, in the swimming pool (I tested it to about 12ft depth), in the hot tub, the rain, the sprinkler, the snow, the river, the sink, even some waterfalls, EVERYWHERE I could use it underwater I did and it ALWAYS held up without leaking! I had this camera since Target started selling it in 2009 and it lasted me until yesterday (2014), about 5 years! I was hell on this camera, so I'd say its definitely durable! Sand never hurt it, dropping it on everything never hurt it (I never put it in a case & I lost the wrist strap so it fell a lot, not to mention EVERYTHING in my purse always breaks but this camera never did), I even lost it out of my pocket in the pouring rain once and found it about 6 hours later laying in swampy flooded grass in perfect working order! The battery always lasted me all day if I used it after a full overnight charge. It takes decent pictures, the only problems I had were in low light conditions with blurriness. I was surprised at the sound quality compared to any other digital camera I've had, it was weird how much better everything sounded. From my fiance's acoustic and electric guitar jams, to louder live performances like concerts and rave events, even underwater videos of my niece yelling "Marco Polo". This camera had good sound quality in every tone, volume, and setting/climate/environment. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Sometimes the flash is too bright up close and in low light (without flash) it can be too dark and blurry but with decent light it is good quality. It has a decent zoom and takes good quality magnified shots. The only otherissues I ever had with it were that the battery cover piece on the camera wore and cracked over time, and I cracked the screen somehow (small 1/2 inch crack on edge of screen) but the camera still never retained water or had any difficulties. Picture perfect ;)  After 5 years I broke it beyond repair but I am assuming normal people aren't as hard on digital cameras as me :P. Overall, it was a sturdy camera that does what it says and does it pretty well. I think it was worth every penny paid. Good starter camera for responsible teens.
Canon PowerShot SD960IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch LCD	17-JUL-14	3	Great product, but quit working shortly after warranty period expired.	It was great while it worked, unfortunately it didn't last very long. Camera broke not too long after the warranty period had expired.  I bought a different brand from Costco that is exceeding my expectations.  I doubt I will buy another Sony product. I had the same thing happen with a Sony Camcorder that ended up developing an issue with the auto focus just after the warranty expired.
Canon PowerShot SD960IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch LCD	07-AUG-14	5	PRODUCT WONDERFUL ! It is Amazon that sucks	The product was wonderful, and in the future I will by-pass Amazon and go directly to the source to purchase the item but I will never again buy from Amazon. This is a totally user unfriendly company with no practical way to contact them personally when there is a problem with one's account. try it your self-If you have a problem, see if you can find how to call them.. Their sign in and account software is set up to discriminate against foreigners. For example, I went to log in from my residence in another country, was recognized as being on a different computer than the last time, and then asked security questions regarding  my account that I was unable to answer, as the questions asked were about my past credit cards and telephone numbers. Sorry I change them and move a lot, and cannot always remember 6 year old information. Most other more sophisticated sites, set up by people with more intelligence ask questions such as your first pet's name. Well you only have ONE first pet. Cannot forget certain things . I my case, I have had several accounts, and after failing , I was blocked by their computer, and could NEVER get back in , despite trying their online chat with a useless first day on the job employee named Gercel, and unable to talk with anyone knowledgeable on their toll free number that by the way I could only obtain through a google search, NOT on their own web site. So, Amazon, if you don't want me as a customer you have succeeded.  NO more for me , and I WILL tell my friends.
Canon PowerShot SD780IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD	24-JUL-14	5	5 years old and still as good as new	I bought this camera in 2009 when it first came out.  I am no photographer, just someone who likes good quality pictures/videos.  Mostly of my kids activities.  As for pictures, the SD780 nails it almost every time.  Low light, bright light, action shots no problem.  The videos are just as good as I have not touched my very nice Canon camcorder in years.  My iPhone takes ok spur of the moment photos but when I know a photo op is going to occur I grab my PowerShot.  It has been exposed to all sorts of weather elements, beaches, dust, etc and is as good as the day as I bought it.

Canon PowerShot A1100IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD	31-JUL-14	5	Outstanding Compact Travel Camera!	This is a great little travel camera.  I like that it has both a video screen and an eye-level viewer, which works so much better in bright sunlight.  I also like that it uses replaceable AA batteries.  As someone who has traveled all over the world, I know how frustrating it can be to have rechargeable batteries die just when great photo opportunities occur.  AA batteries are available just about everywhere.  It also uses the standard SD card.  There's really no excuse for running out of storage capacity or power with this little jewel of a compact camera.  I own professional digital camera equipment but often let this little guy handle the routine assignments.

Intova CP9 9 Megapixel Compact Camera (Refurbished)	31-JUL-14	1	Junk!!!	Piece of Junk!  This was a new camera (not refurbished) I received as  a present, and it's only been used once.  Battery cover broke the second time I opened it, to replace the batteries. Camera still works when in the UW housing, but not as stand alone camera-the batteries fall out.. As an aside,  None of my rechargeable AAA batteries (Powerex, Enercell, and Duracell)  fit the housing.

Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD	31-JUL-14	5	A most excellent camera.	This is an EXCELLENT camera! It takes great photos with all of the camera adjustments that a photographer could possibly need, and it's compact (a true requirement of mine, because though I enjoy photography, if the camera is bulky I may not take it on all of the possible adventures that I may experience).. The video is easily shot and good quality. Once you learn the camera a video can be rolling in a few seconds from the camera being off.. I've had this camera for a few years now. It's been to Kauai a few times, and all over the South-Western U.S. I find it to be an excellent instrument for capturing life's events.. When the wife and I need our photo taken and ask a stranger to do so, they always exclaim "Wow! This is a nice camera.". Always. And it truly is.

This is probably a pretty good camera but it didn't come with a user's manual (I bought from an individual) so I went to the Panasonic website to see if I could download one.  When I type in the model number - tried several different ways to type it -  it just says "not found."  Panasonic has no "Contact Us" link; absolutely no way to contact customer support - if they even have one.  You are just on your own!  I gave this camera 3 stars because I am familiar with Panasonic cameras and they generally take good pictures; however, if you actually expect customer support for a $300 camera, I suggest you look elsewhere.

Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera (Black, Body Only)	15-JUL-14	1	If you spent $6k on this, you definitely have more money than brains.	Easily summed up. This $6,000 Leica M9 is inferior in every respect to any other camera system costing $6,000. There's nothing more to say.
Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera (Black, Body Only)	07-AUG-14	4	Transitioning to the M9	I'm obviously a bit late to the party here, but I needed to wait for the price of an M9 to begin to return to earth before making my purchase.  I'll talk about this camera from the perspective of someone coming from an M6, and hope to address some questions or concerns others may have when deciding to make the jump from a film to a digital Leica M.. The camera is very close in weight to the M6, and the build quality feels similar as well.  The main thing you will notice right away is that the M9 is thicker than the M6.  It is noticeable, and when handling the two cameras side by side I prefer the smaller M6, however in practice I have found that I don't really care about the added thickness when I am out shooting.. The M9 has a larger shutter speed dial similar to the TTL version of the M6.  I will admit that this does handle better than the smaller dial on the classic M6.  The frame line preview works as before, and the finder is mostly similar to the M6, with some slight changes to the frame lines and a slightly different light meter with a dot between the opposing arrows that indicate over or under exposure.  None of these changes are problematic, as far as I am concerned.. The only other significant difference you will notice is the way the shutter button responds to pressure.  The M6 has a two stage button; half press to meter, full press to fire.  The M9 is a three stage, and can be configured to operate in several different ways.  The standard setup is you activate the meter with the first stage, lock the exposure with the second stage, full press to fire.  This can be changed in several ways, primarily by engaging the "soft" release function which trips the shutter at the second stage.  You may find you prefer this setup if you do not use the aperture priority function, and therefore have no need to lock the exposure.  In addition to the soft function, there is a "discrete" mode in which the shutter does not re-cock until you remove your finger from the shutter button.  I have found that I like this mode very much, as it allows you to take the photo with minimal noise and then lower the camera before re-cocking the shutter, which makes a brief whirring sound.. A note about that whirring sound:  In my opinion, it is the only mechanical function of this camera that could use improvement.  Quite frankly the sound is annoying, and doesn't sound like a Leica should sound.  Perhaps that's a ridiculous thing to say, but I am pretty sure if you are coming from a film M you will feel the same way.  The smooth film advance has been replaced by a whirring noise.  It's not the end of the world.  I'll get over it.. As far as the electronics are concerned, they're spartan and good enough.  The LCD is lousy by today's standards.  ISO can be changed easily by pressing the ISO button and turning the command wheel.  You can check your battery life easily, and battery life is relatively good.  The menu system is simple to negotiate; there aren't a lot of extraneous setting to fiddle around with, thank goodness.  The blown highlight/shadow indicators in the image review are accurate and helpful.  Frankly, you will likely set this camera up the way you want it, and then ignore the menu system most of the time.  Most electronic interaction is then limited to changing ISO on occasion (if you don't use auto-ISO) and checking your battery.  DNG files are fairly slow to write to the card, taking maybe 5 seconds per image.  You may run into the buffer if you shoot very quickly; I rarely have this problem.  The electronics thankfully do not really interfere with the overall shooting experience.. Image quality is a double edged sword.  This sensor likes to have some light, but not too much.  Highlight recovery isn't as good as a modern day DSLR.  Watch out you don't blow your highlights too badly.  when they're gone, they're gone.  There can also be some strange artifacting around badlyblown areas.  (The center-weighted meter is very sensitive to highlights, I suspect for this reason.)  High ISO performance isn't wonderful either.  Frankly, I've mostly kept the M9 at ISO 800 or below, occasionally going to 1600.  This is good enough for me, but I admit I wouldn't complain if it were better!  Those used to shooting at 6400 on a current DSLR may find the performance lacking in this regard.  When used within its limitations, however, the M9 files are absolutely wonderful.  They record an amazing amount of detail; I have more or less refrained from adding any sharpening to the DNG files in post-processing.  They convert to black and white very well, which was of primary importance for me, making very nicely toned, rich black and white conversions.  I almost never work in color so I will refrain from commenting on the quality of the colors out of the M9.. If you are considering making the switch from an M6 or other film M, I think you will be happy with the M9.  You'll likely wish for an improvement in the sound of the shutter cocking, but otherwise you can pickup the M9 and basically shoot with it as you would a film M.  If you have not used a Leica and are wondering if a rangefinder is for you, I would strongly recommend picking up a used film M with a 35 or 50mm lens and living with it for six months or so to determine whether or not a rangefinder system is right for you.

Opteka Underwater Case/Waterproof Housing for Canon EOS, Nikon, Sony, Olympus & Pentax DSLR Camera (Rated Depth of 30')	13-AUG-14	3	It is what it is	If you want to protect your cameras.  and take pictures with a whole lot of learning then this s a great choice. This product is a frustrating device that you will never love but you will love for the protection it gives to your $1000 camera. It does what it does and gave me the courage to use it in underwater conditions. There is nothing wrong with product. It does what it says. There are all kinds of problems making them happen but if you are patient your can make them happen. This is a protection device and love it for that.

Vivitar Freelance 3-in-1 Digital Camera - Red	16-JUL-14	1	garbage, even at this price	Got this at the drug store for my daughter to take to sleepover camp. On reading the instructions (after buying it) we learned that all of the photos get erased if the batteries run down OR if the batteries are removed and changed. My daughter was so afraid of the batteries running out she refused to turn it on. We later learned that we had accidentally tossed the driver CD (apparently hidden inside the packaging) and that it doesn't work with a Mac anyway.  rendering it basically garbage x3.

Casio Exilim G Ex-g1 Digital Camera Ex-g1 Red Ex-g1 Rd	06-AUG-14	2	NOT waterproof as advertised!	Advertised as "waterproof to 3 meters/10 feet".  I understand keeping proper expectations, but this wasn't listed as "splash resistant"  it is claimed to be waterPROOF (this is actually engraved on the side of the camera).. The first two times I got this wet it was fine, the third time it was a goner.  I never got it more than 2 feet under the water.  When it did fail it was obvious water had permeated the device, with fog and water droplets forming inside the lens, the led light, and the xenon flash housings.. We bought this specifically for use in and around water and have been let down due to false advertising.
Olympus SP-800UZ 14MP Digital Camera with 30x Wide Angle Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0 inch LCD	05-AUG-14	4	It IS what they say it is...a pretty good picture taker	I got this camera a few days ago from my local pawn shop. I didn't do any research on it b4 the purchased it because it was an Olympus AND it has the huge 30x zoom. With the price tag of $100 how could I go wrong?.  Well. shooting video leaves a lot to be desired because you can't zoom in or out while you're filming. It does take a little more than moment to focus up AND, the pics could be a little crisper, I guess. But for this price point, I have to give it a 4 star out of 5 simply because of the video shortcomings. Overall, it's a great camera for me. it serves my needs because I don't do this for a living. I'd buy it again.    P.S. I read in one of the reviews that someone couldn't get a pic of the hummingbirds. I have some  here from my front yard I want y'all to see (If they allow that sort of thing here). Hope this link works:

This one did as well.  Ugh.   Quality control could be better.  But, almost everyone just uses the camera built in to their smartphones these days, so I suppose this is redundant.

This is the best digital camera I have ever had for still shots.  I previously owned one that was black but the same model and I lost it.  I was so happy to find this new one to replace it.  The pictures are always crisp and clear.  It is a great "point and click" camera as well as having features for close-ups and video.  I can thoroughly recommend it.  If you can find a new one on-line then I would buy this over other digitial cameras for the same price.

Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 14.1 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue)	21-JUL-14	5	I've had this camera now for over 3 years and use it almost weekly in harsh conditions and it still works great an was one of my	I bought this camera off a whim in the Dubai airport and was certain I was getting ripped off.  However, I've had this camera now for over 3 years and use it almost weekly in harsh conditions and it still works great an was one of my best purchases ever.  I have tried many other shockproof/waterproof cameras before only to have them survive one trip then die.  I live in sub-Saharan Africa where it's constantly dusty.  This camera has been to the bottom of Lake Malawi, in the oceans in Mozambique, up Kilimanjaro, snows of Alaska and has yet to let me down.  I have dropped it many times from heights that would normally destroy a camera, but this one just bounces and continues working.  I've dropped it 100 m down in a lake, found it 3 hours later and still worked fine.  It's been in many a monsoon rainstorm, sandstorms, and snow storms.. I would suggest getting the camera with it's small plastic protection sheath (not the large one); this helps keep the dirt, sand, and water out of the internal portions.  The camera will tell you when there's a piece of sand in the insides (it's never been wrong).. Photo quality is great and I'm often asked if photos are off an SLR.  Zoom though compromises the quality and photos become grainy when blown up.. Underwater pictures are clear and does an excellent job capturing underwater color.. If want a camera that you can abuse and will be forgiving, go with this Lumix.
Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 14.1 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue)	05-AUG-14	4	I was sent the wrong camera, but like the wrong one better now. And these cameras are pretty great, too.	OK.  I'm giving this 3-stars ONLY because of the fact that this was NOT the product I had originally bought. Apparently, if they are out of the product you pay for, they simply send you the next step up instead. And it caused me to have to go buy an entirely different underwater housing so that I can take it diving in greater depths without worrying. This was addressed, and the seller refunded my difference, and actually the camera I bought is even better. So I'll chalk it up as a win-win.. That being said, these TS2 models are great! I've owned one before and took it around the world on dive trips a few times before it randomly died on dry land. The image quality isn't as stunning as my Canon Powershot G models, by any means, but they are rugged enough to take everywhere and not have to worry about rain or being on a boat, or sand. I just wish the color and clarity of images were a little better. But I know it's hard to compete with Canon, Fuji, or Sony in that field!. The model that I was actually sent when I purchased this product, was the Lumix TS-5 model. And, although this forced me to have to make another large purchase to have the underwater housing, I can honestly say the TS-5 model is actually quite a step up from the original one! There is an advanced underwater function that adds a bit of a red filter to get better color accuracy underwater, and there is also a handheld night shot setting, and a long exposure (15 or 30 seconds) that is great for taking low light images. I've noticed the lighting captures better as well. OH - and there's Wi-Fi on this one, so you can send images to your phone, in case you want to send someone images or post online while you're out of range of your computer. So there's that. Even though I was EXTREMELY unhappy when I made the purchase, this last dive trip has helped me warm up to the fact that I ended up getting a better camera.
Vivitar Vivicam 8690 Silver 8.1 Megapixel Digital Camera	07-AUG-14	4	I really like the camera	I really like the camera. I just wish I could get the 1024 resolution. and love the video option . it simple easy to use the menu a little confusing so was better to look online for better instructions but over all it's a great camera for the money. easy to load batteries and the battery compartment clip is good I bought more costly cameras and the battery clip holder breaks. I own three of these now. the digital zoom is easy to use and that a feature I use mostly that and video only holds 8 gig sd card but I live with that. I use it all the time and no complaints got my first one 2 years ago still works but cracked the screen so glued it and made clear plastic cover go over it and works fine. my neighbors like throw rocks at my truck why video important so I get enough video time to load and unload and actually video one neighbor doing it. so yes very happy sorry the camera been discontinue. shame people come out with the right idea on things then poof it gone to something worse. sigh, recommend it . sure will.

Philips See Me See YouÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Digital Camera	11-AUG-14	3	Inexpensive Camera	This is a very inexpensive camera but good enough for my 7yo granddaughter to play around with but that's about it. The plastic mirror on the front slides off the lens which is good protection for the lens and serves nicely for selfies. I have not had a chance to do much with it at this point.

Fujifilm FinePix Z33WP 10 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (...	25-JUL-14	4	My favorite!	I've owned about 4 digital cameras in my life and this Fujifilm Finepix Z33WP was my favorite. (Granted they were all cheaper cameras.)  I broke my Canon camera at the beach (with barely any moisture or sand) and I broke my Nikon camera in a mosh pit so I looked for a waterproof camera with a stable, non retracting lens. This Z33WP was perfect! It went in the ocean with me many times, in the swimming pool (I tested it to about 12ft depth), in the hot tub, the rain, the sprinkler, the snow, the river, the sink, even some waterfalls, EVERYWHERE I could use it underwater I did and it ALWAYS held up without leaking! I had this camera since Target started selling it in 2009 and it lasted me until yesterday (2014), about 5 years! I was hell on this camera, so I'd say its definitely durable! Sand never hurt it, dropping it on everything never hurt it (I never put it in a case & I lost the wrist strap so it fell a lot, not to mention EVERYTHING in my purse always breaks but this camera never did), I even lost it out of my pocket in the pouring rain once and found it about 6 hours later laying in swampy flooded grass in perfect working order! The battery always lasted me all day if I used it after a full overnight charge. It takes decent pictures, the only problems I had were in low light conditions with blurriness. I was surprised at the sound quality compared to any other digital camera I've had, it was weird how much better everything sounded. From my fiance's acoustic and electric guitar jams, to louder live performances like concerts and rave events, even underwater videos of my niece yelling "Marco Polo". This camera had good sound quality in every tone, volume, and setting/climate/environment. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Sometimes the flash is too bright up close and in low light (without flash) it can be too dark and blurry but with decent light it is good quality. It has a decent zoom and takes good quality magnified shots. The only other issues I ever had with it were that the battery cover piece on the camera wore and cracked over time, and I cracked the screen somehow (small 1/2 inch crack on edge of screen) but the camera still never retained water or had any difficulties. Picture perfect ;)  After 5 years I broke it beyond repair but I am assuming normal people aren't as hard on digital cameras as me :P. Overall, it was a sturdy camera that does what it says and does it pretty well. I think it was worth every penny paid. Good starter camera for responsible teens.

GE X5 Power Pro Series 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 15X Optical Zoom	26-JUL-14	5	An Inexpensive Choice for Practical Photographs	I've now had my GE X5 for nearly 5 years and its still going strong. I absolutely love this thing and have even purchased a few more since to give as gifts.. Although I don't take photos as much as I used to this little camera does everything I need when I do want to shoot picture's.. One of the things I have noticed with this aging is when the camera sits and the batteries have begun to discharge is it will cause it to have a problem with the lens opening properly. Just don't try to push or pull it. This just indicates the batteries need changed, pretty simple solution. I use this a lot to take close up photos when I sell on eBay. Sometimes they are too good, if that seems wrong then I will try to explain.  These new digital cameras pick up more than what we would normally see with our plain vision or in other word every speck of dust or crazing in porcelain is enhanced making it show up and look much worse than what we really need to see.. Also sometimes when you are in good lighting and you take a photo of say a nice looking gal who seems to have perfect make-up.  well if she uses concealer around her eyes under the make up then that appears and looks like raccoon eyes. Its actually quite funny unless you are wanting that perfect family photo.. If you are expecting to take professional photos for something such as the main wedding pics then I would recommend something better however if you are going on vacation and just want an easy to use camera that takes good photos then at this price tit perfect.. One thing I did do was purchase larger cards for these but unless you take a whole lot of photos or plan to record a lot then I don't recommend too much space otherwise when you take it to get them printed you'll be there forever.. Bottom line, this is inexpensive, practical and a nice little camera to have.

Nice 8X lens & features, programs.  Came out aorund 2010 or 2011, so a bit dated now if you're buying at retail.  My only complaint is that the battery compartment door often opens accidently.  The sound & volume level on videos is very low when using camera playback.

Had one that I loved, dropped it and wanted another.. Great little camera, ties great photos even in 3D!
Sony TX Series DSC-TX9/H 12.2MP Digital Still Camera with "Exmor R" CMOS Sensor and 3D Sweep Panorama	12-AUG-14	5	This TX Cyber-shot 12 Megapixel Sony Really Rocks !	This is a very good Sony DSC-TX,Sony's cyber shot range camera. I love its sleek,thin stylish designed and elegance with a 3.5inch large screen in the rear,and all the menu settings by touching the fully occupied rear screen that 's very responsive. Its Sony's 3.6v rechargable battery is not so good in the long run on the shooting with only 630MAh juice but it's not bad on holding the charge and taking more photos than any AA rechargable batteries of my other Nikon,Canon digital cameras. The camera captures impressive landscapes with iSweep Panorama wide mode and in 3D.But I do not and I haven't used the 3-D mode.  The camera takes clear and crisp images in low light. This camera can take a very good picture and shooting a cool video in a very low light,I mean just a dim sleeping light. Thanks to Sony's "Exmor R" CMOS sensor. You'll also be impressed by Superior Auto, Background Defocus and Full HD 1080/60i AVCHD movies.8 Enjoy it all on an easy to view 3.5" touch screen. I do not travel and using the Sony camera a lot. On the other hand, I use it to take advertisement photos for the Internet selling merchandises and I was amazed its clear and crisp pictures to provide the very clear and details in every picture I took. The best thing I really like about this Sony is its top of the line 25mm Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens(4x optimal zoom). I am not good in typing and am not want to by using this Sony to take a very close-up pictures of their ants like really small instructional words on my selling item's outer boxes that other cameras don't. I have many good digital cameras and they provided very vibrant photos in normal shootings but downed side(blurred)in taking a very close up that almost touches the shooting objects with the very,very small words printed on the merchandise I needed for my photo ads. And besides this Sony,hi-end smart phones such as i-phones and Samsung phones also do too! Although its 12 megapixels,it takes very beautiful pictures and sometimes exceeds other brand cameras with 18 megapixels and it processes a large digital files than other cameras do and it processes 3.8 to 4 megabyte digital file on a single photo that I set to only 8 megapixel mode. The two gig sd card comes with the camera just merely enough for your casual photos. If you're traveling and need a video shooting on this Sony,that's a big different thing. With 1080i AVCHD Movie Mode and I think avchd might be a Blu-ray movie mode that it takes a huge file with 30 minutes of shooting,it might consumes a 20-25 gig of digital blu-ray file that you need at least a 16-32gig sd card and I have two ultra fast 64gig sd cards for my movie modes. This Sony shoots a very beautiful video that you won't be dis-pointed ! The draw-back is it does not have stabilized built-in,so be really careful to stable(impressed your movements)when you're shooting the videos,otherwise the blurred result.

Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS10	19-JUL-14	5	the seals and gaskets work just fine.	I bought this as a gift for one of our daughters several years ago and she is still using it.  When I bought it, it was the top rated waterproof small camera.  It has produced both outstanding photos and exceptional HD videos.  It is a gem.  It is still totally waterproof; the seals and gaskets work just fine.
Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5	23-JUL-14	4	Very good ... but NOT great.	I typically use RAW. I'm glad to have it and the ability to adjust the Aperture and Shutter Speed manually. However, the "grain" of my photos is very noticeable; it doesn't look like film grain, it's just weird and somewhat ugly.

Fujifilm FinePix J40 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Includes 2 GB SD Memory Card)	27-JUL-14	4	Much nicer than the price would lead you to believe!	I bought this because it was cheap and my young daughter wanted her own digital camera.  I've had to use it when I forget my camera and have been quite impressed with its image quality for the price.  Plus, it's been about two years and my accident-prone child hasn't broken it yet and she uses it A LOT.  Great product.
Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD	14-JUL-14	4	meh, it's not bad...	It's not a bad camera, not a great one either.  but it takes interesting pictures. If you do it just right, it takes pictures with a lot of depth and detail, it's almost like being there. I guess it takes some practice. I'm not sure if it's this thing's fault or not, but my memory card doesn't work in the camera anymore. It works fine in the computer, I got the pictures from it, but the camera is using internal memory, which is about 3 3-D pictures. I do have a bit of buyer's remorse.
Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD	27-JUL-14	5	an excellent camera for its  price	An excellent camera- compact, well-designed, and versatile.  I bought a second one because I liked it so much.  There is much to recommend it.
Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD	29-JUL-14	3	Not bad but not as good as it could be.	I like the 3D screen on the back of the W3 that you can view without the glasses. The images the camera shoots are good in high light levels but the quality falls off quickly in lower light. The biggest issue with the W3 is the lens is not very wide so composition might be a challenge in tight places.. I also had a issue with the video feature with a dead pixel that apparently is fairly common according to some searches I did on this camera.. The W3 is fairly inexpensive these days and is fun to mess around with as a hobby camera but if you want to get serious get the dual go-pro 3d package.
Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD	04-AUG-14	5	Wow	For the price, this thing is amazing.  A few dead pixels on the screen now, but it does not affect the quality of the image at all.  The results are still amazing, especially when plugged into my 3D TV.  Still can't believe I am seeing a 3D image without glasses on the built-in screen - neither can anyone else I show.
Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD	07-AUG-14	4	A decent replacement from the old 3d film cameras.	I still own two 3d film cameras with three lenses each and was disappointed to learn that the developing of the film from those cameras is pretty much nonexistent.  I know Snap3d advertises making 3d prints out of 3d digital files made from those cameras and the newest digital 3d cameras. From their website, I researched various digital cameras and decided to buy this one. It is a 2 lens camera with rechargeable battery.  For those who don't have a 3d TV like myself, this will show you what the pictures look like and your current view in 3d.  I haven't tried too many shots indoors that require the flash.  Some pictures seem impossible to take in 3d. How is that so? I don't know but there is an adjustment at the top of the camera to try to align the left and right pictures taken from those lenses on each picture. My biggest complaint is the rotating wheel on the upper right in the back used to change selections is too loose and can move if put in a pocket or bag.  I have found the wheel to have moved from simply taking it out of the bag from the last time I used it. Other than that, it is a decent replacement in the now digital picture world from the old 3d film cameras. There is a side of me that will keep looking for something better but this will work for now.

Vivitar ViviCam iTwist V7028 Digital Camera - Blueberry	09-AUG-14	1	Breaks easy	This camera broke not long after I got it. Not as in a cracked screen or doesn't record I mean it won't even turn on anymore even with a whole night of it being on the charger. This happened a few days after I got it and all I did with it was put it on my desk.
Canon PowerShot SX130IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD	30-JUL-14	2	My Canon SX-130 Camera is an Alkaline Battery Junkie	I've been a fan of Canon since waaay back in the film days.  Canon quality was bar none; Canon even made copiers that were excellent.  So it was no wonder I bought this camera, after researching many models.  I bought  it because 1) it was heavy enough to hold in my hand (smaller cameras tend to "take wings and fly" while I'm shooting, thereby making a blurry picture), 2) it was a Canon, 3) it has a nice telephoto lens and 4) the screen on back  was large enough so that I didn't have to go running for my glasses every time I was shooting.  This was my first experience with a digital camera, if that gives you an idea.. What I now have with over two years of shooting is a serious problem with battery life.  At first, the alkalines (just two) seemed to last forever.  I didn't use video so it was no wonder. Then I decided to buy some rechargables when the alkalines started showing some wear.  A set of four RayoVac I thought should do the trick.  Well, for a while.  Then I thought it was the rechargables--could I have left them charging for too long?  Maybe.  The red light on the charger never went off after the first time I charged them and used them in the camera.  Hmmm.  Another set of rechargeables, 2800 mah, bought here on Amazon and specifically for the camera (at least it said).  And after the very first charge and battery insertion, the camera acted like I needed new ones after never having taken a shot.  So back to the alkalines.  Which seem to have it working, but with a limited number of shots.. With reading the reviews here, I seem to feel it's the camera and not the batteries.  How could this be?  But there seems to be a common thread with all the reviews--it's the camera.  And the sad thing is, I can't return it.  I just have to accept my camera is hooked on alkaline batteries, and some days it uses a lot of juice, and some days it doesn't.  Maybe it's time I bought the adapter and shelve the rechargables.
Canon PowerShot SX130IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD	11-AUG-14	5	Five Stars	fantastic, simple camera. easy to carry and takes great photos either in manual or automatic.

Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD	27-JUL-14	5	best point-and-shoot camera ever	This is the best camera I've ever had in my life, simple as that. Canon really hit the spot on this one. All pictures look great and you really don't need to do anything besides focusing and taking the picture. I've had experience with semi-professional cameras and all, but this little one always travels with me since it's the best point-and-shooter you'll ever experience within this price range (believe me, it's cheap for what it does)

Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD	17-JUL-14	5	Perfect blend of SLR meets point-n-shoot	This camera is the perfect blend of SLR meets point-n-shoot! It's so simple, yet versatile that it meets the needs and experience of a variety of photographers. The quality is excellent, ease of use, and fits in the hand perfectly. Nice big LCD screen for viewing and more solidly built than an 'ole point-n-shoot camera.. I've had this camera for a while now and am still satisfied and use it regularly. In fact, I gave up the big bulky SLR for the G12 as it's more compact and does just a good a job!
Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD	25-JUL-14	3	bulky and overpriced.	Waaay overpriced. Image quality is okay for a point and shoot but this thing is maaasssive. And oberpriced. Get a lumix for much less and it's just as good. Prolly better due to the 1.4 lens they have now. Also, optical viewfinder? Really? Who cares? I'd take smaller if it means you'll get rid of the dumb viewfinder.
Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD	27-JUL-14	4	Nice, solid camera	Pretty flexible, solid camera with nice weight in the hand. Fits nicely in a cargo pant pocket or on my belt. Love the big, tilting viewing screen. Seems to be sharp with good color and I like being able to quickly choose among several ratio formats. I shoot mainly on manual, so I think the camera is a little sluggish when moving between settings and the * button on the back of the camera is badly placed. I constantly press this button by accident when making an adjustment and it changes my exposure settings to an unwanted default.

Casio EX-H20GBK Hybrid-GPS Enabled 14 MP Digital Camera with 10x Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)	05-AUG-14	1	Crappy Cameras- Quit working after 5 months.	Bought 2 cameras in Feb 2014 and in July 2014 they both quit working.  They would not turn on anymore.  Sent them back to Casio to see about getting them repaired and they said it will cost $150 for each camera to fix.  We did not misuse these cameras,  they just stopped working one day.  Pretty crappy item if they quit working for no apparent reason and then Casio wants to charge to fix their defective equipment.
Canon PowerShot SD1300IS	17-JUL-14	4	worked fine. Dropped it	Shopping for an upgrade, I saw the unhappy reviews here about this camera's durability.  I've had the opposite experience, so felt I should give another view point. Bought my camera back in early 2010.  I've taken it to all kinds of places, in my jeans pocket, no case.. It's been in my pocket when it poured down rain, worked fine. Dropped it, more than a few times, no issues. It's been stolen by a cat as a toy, and dragged under furniture, no damage.  Taken 1000's of pictures, zooming in and out.  Made in China. Camera buttons and lens all still work flawlessly, and look great.  Crawled around in dusty, and fur filled areas, while holding the camera. Pictures don't have any dark spots from any particles in the lens.. No, I've not cleaned the camera, other than to wipe the LCD screen on my shirt.  Only deducting one star because I feel irritated about having to buy another camera only 4 years later, to get better pictures. Honestly, that's not really the camera's fault.. My only issue is I started taking pictures of small moving animals in low light conditions, and need something a bit more detailed. (If you can't tell from that prior sentence, I'm strictly an ordinary point and shoot user.)  Not entirely certain what I want is even being made though.. This camera had the easiest to operate, with one hand, on/off button I've seen.  The Elph 330 seems like the best upgrade, camera-wise, due to the 340 being less of a camera than the 330, annoyingly.  Unfortunately I got spoiled with this color option, and was hoping for another blue, preferably darker. Considering I don't think they have made an upgrade that is 100% an upgrade (on/off button, etc.), this camera probably deserves a 5 star rating.

Nikon Coolpix S4000 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Panel LCD	17-JUL-14	5	Very pleased.	This is a great little point and shoot.  I have been looking for a second camera to use for photographing very realistic dolls I paint and sell.  I'd been using a Coolpix S4000, and had good results, but thought I'd try another Nikon with 20MP.  It was horrible- all photos were blurred, so I sent it back within 24 hours of getting it.. I came back to the S4000, and don't regret it at all.  I got a different color from my first, to tell them apart (personal photos vs. photos for selling the dolls).  There are many different settings for outdoors, portraits, macro, landscape, etc.  I keep both of them set on auto flash, and the doll camera is kept on Macro most of the time, for close ups on fingernails and eyes- when I crop them, they don't lose sharpness.  I've used the auto-timer with great success when I want to be in a photo (family shots).  I did a LOT of 35mm SLR photography in the past, and while I still enjoy those photographs, the photos from this is definitely adequate for my needs- whether family photos, outdoor photos, to take to museums, etc.. Bottom line:  It is a good enough camera to have gotten another one, 3 years after getting the first.
Nikon Coolpix S4000 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Panel LCD	23-JUL-14	1	Waste of money	Camera worked for two weeks and quit. I plan to return it when I return to US.
Nikon Coolpix S4000 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Panel LCD	11-AUG-14	5	Cool Coolpix!	Great camera. Convenient size. The only thing I've run into is the pop-up flash is located in a bad spot -- the top left side where your finger has to be when holding the camera. I've owned this for a few years now, and I always forget. It doesn't stop it from flashing, but if it has to be on top, it would be better if it were located in the middle. Otherwise, I'm thrilled with this purchase.

Refurbished and works like new.
Sony DSC-W330 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Zoom with Digital Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCD	10-AUG-14	3	Glad I tried it but....	Not too happy with this camera.

Sony DSC-TX7 10.2MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Zoom with Optical Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.5 inch Touch Screen LCD	29-JUL-14	4	My go to point and shoot	I've had this camera for over 4 years (starting to catch up on my reviews) and it is still my to go point and shoot. My favorite part is the video quality and iSweep panorama (loved it). The reason why I removed 1 star was because night / low light  shooting is not great with Intelligent Auto Auto mode. Hand-held twilight is wonderful for these moments, but sometimes you just want to point and shoot and HHT takes too long to shoot spontaneously causing you to miss the moment.. The only thing I regret is not getting a screen protector for the touch screen as mine got a bit damaged last year after shooting in the snow. But even with that damage and several falls it is a very durable camera cause it is still working perfectly.

Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX100V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 30x Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080 Video	11-AUG-14	5	My Uber-Camera!	I call this my "uber-camera" because the photos I've taken with it are so incredibly good.  I've used this camera across the Caribbean and continental US, and I have no complaints at all.  The video is high-quality, the sound is great, and you can't hear the zoom during video use.  I'm a point-and-shoot photographer, so I don't take full advantage of all the features.  But my photos look professional, and I am able to capture great memories and zoom to get architectural details when sightseeing or great photos when sitting in the back of a performance center.  This camera has been my faithful companion for a couple of years now, and I'm so very happy with the purchase.  I can't recommend it enough!
Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 16.2 MP Waterproof Digital Still Camera with Exmor R CMOS Sensor, 3D Sweep Panorama, and Full HD 1080/60i Video (Silver)	28-JUL-14	1	Do not buy this camera!	This camera took a few good pictures before it started to crack in multiple locations around the screen. We didn't notice at first as they started as small cracks, but this was enough to let water seep in and destroy the camera. We sent the camera back to Sony and had it repaired, but only to have the same exact problem reoccur a few months later. The second time it happened it seemed the casing was literally crumbling. It got worse every time we picked it up. Upon contacting Sony again, they informed me it is a known problem with this model but it was past warranty so no refund and repairs could no longer be done without a flat rate of $90. Considering the poor quality of this product, I will save my money and go with a completely different camera next time.

Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 16x Optical Zoom G Lens, 3D Sweep Panorama and Full HD 1080/60p Video	14-JUL-14	5	Best Camera That I Have Seen - In This Price Range.	I take hundreds of pictures of my grand daughter's sporting events. This camera does what some of those fancy LARGE cameras do - - But this camera is so small that you can carry it in a camera case on your belt. I take mostly action shots and this camera stops the ball in the air without blurring the picture. I am not a pro at picture taking - but the pictures I get - make me look as if I know a lot about taking pictures. I truly love my camera and have been using it for about 2 years now.. I hope they come out with a even stronger zoom lens. I love bringing in those far away shots.. And do't forget that this camera takes as good of video pictures as most hand held video cameras. So you don't need to take a video camera with you. You get 2 cameras in one.. I can't say enough good things about this camera.. Thank You Sony for making such a good camera.

Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 16x Optical Zoom G Lens, 3D Sweep Panorama and Full HD 1080/60p Video	19-JUL-14	5	I love the camera	This is my go-to camera when I don't want to carry my heavy Canon 5D Mark II.  I love the camera.  The quality of prints and video is unsurpassed for a small camera.  The video capability is amazing.  The optical zoom range is one of the longest out there.  With one exception, is is almost the perfect camera.  That exception is that there is no optical viewfinder, so you must use the screen to frame the picture or video.  In bright sunlight, that is virtually impossible.  (This problem is certainly not unique to this camera; it comes with every camera without an optical viewfinder.)  There is a good fix, however.  For not much money, you can buy a foldable sun screen to cover the screen on the top and both sides.  While it isn't made for this camera, it works well.

Kodak Easyshare Sport C123 Digital Camera	13-AUG-14	1	Disappointed in Kodak	Do not purchase!!!!!!  This camera took great underwater pictures and videos for the first couple of times.  Eventually, the lens started to fog and the pictures would come out cloudy.  Then the camera would not turn on.  Come to find out water had gotten into the battery compartment and the batteries were rusted.  We tried cleaning the rust out and replacing the batteries, but the camera will still not turn on.  I called Kodak and they wanted to charge me $15.00 for the call.  I tried chat & email through Kodak and was told their support is not longer available for this DISCONTINUED product?!?!!?  I am furious, as we had the camera for less than a year.  It was still under warranty.  I am very disappointed in Kodak and do not plan to purchase any more items from them!

Samsung EC-PL120 Digital Camera with 14.2 MP and 5x Optical Zoom (Black)	28-JUL-14	5	Great camera	Was a bit skeptical when I was buying this camera. It was not new so I decided to get spare batteries for it. Over a year now the battery it came with remains in it and goes for days before the next recharge. Give clear bright images. Funny enough, it's the right tool for what has come to be known as selfies today because of it's front display. Very portable small and handy too. I just love

GE PJ1 14.1MP Digital Camera and PICO Projector with 7X Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD with Auto Brightness (Black)	28-JUL-14	4	Unusual camera with a pico projector built in	I got this to speed up tracing pictures for my art.  I use a tripod arm to position  the camera over my drawing board.  The camera quality is good, as is the projector.  Easy to focus the projector.  Fine color rendition unlike some other pico projectors that I've tested.  Both camera and projector functions are more than adequate for this purpose, more maneuverable and more convenient than using a full size projector.  I can also use photos taken on my other cameras and pictures that I've edited on my computer simply by transferring them to the PJ1 on an HC SD card (up to 16GB).  No problems encountered so. I like it.  Not sure why there aren't more of these around, as it's a neat idea.

Olympus 14 Megapixel Stylus Tough-6020 Digital Camera- Choose Color	02-AUG-14	5	Love this camera!	This is definitely the best waterproof camera out there!  There is no downside.
Olympus 14 Megapixel Stylus Tough-6020 Digital Camera- Choose Color	03-AUG-14	2	Before you buy this camera do your research!	I received this camera as a gift. It worked fine for almost two years. But keep in mind I only used this camera on my summer kayak trips. About 4 times a summer the rest of the time it was unused and stored correctly. I took very good care of this camera. It was never abused or misused in anyway. I never dropped it even though it is supposed to be shock proof. I never left it submerged in water and never had it more then 2ft deep for short periods of time. That being said it was rarely used and looks brand new and basically is. But on my last trip it just quit working. After a day on the river I plugged it up to charge and it wouldn't charge, it wouldn't come on, it wouldn't do anything. And has never worked again. The olympus web site said a non warranty (over a year) repair would be $119.96. Though I was pleased with the quality of the pics this camera took it is not worth the cost of repair. My satisfaction with the rest of the camera functions on a scale of 1 to 10 I would have to say about a 5. I am going to purchase another waterproof camera but it will not be an olympus.

3:2 Swi-View LCDVF LCD Viewfinder for Canon 60D, T3i, any other 3:2 3" LCD Cameras by Carry Speed	14-JUL-14	3	You get what you pay for..	Works ok for the price.  I would probably try another viewfinder as I feel this item is very cheaply made.  If your looking for something cheap buy it.  If you have a bit more money to spend get a better viewfinder it will make your life easier when filming.

After some practice	I wanted to get a digital camera for my 5 year old niece. All the kids' cameras were only 1.3 mega pixels & $30-40.  I got this one instead. Refurbished, it was about the same price as the kids' cameras & takes much better photos. After some practice, my niece found it fairly easy to use.  She wasn't able to use the more advanced features of course but managed to figure out how to zoom in & out and take photos.  I used it a couple of times as well and took some great photos.

Nikon COOLPIX S9100 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 18x NIKKOR ED Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video	14-JUL-14	2	Nikon has produced a very problematic and flawed camera. Very frustrating when it won't work properly.	I have been using this camera for about 2 years now and found it a very problematic camera.  I use the zoom on the camera frequently and since the beginning and I have lost many a good photo because sometime when I push the zoom switch and the lens is extending to take the shot it will stop half way through and will give a message "Lens Error". I am then required to turn the camera off and back on and try to take the shot again. More often than not I will get the same "Lens Error" and the frustration is extreme. It also has a tendency to lock up where none of the buttons work, the lens won't move and the camera is completely frozen. At these times removing the battery is the only answer I've found.. When I was researching cameras to buy I thought.  "It's a Nikon, it has to be good", that turned out not to be the case. I sincerely wish I could say good things about this camera but my recommendation has to be to save yourself a lot of frustration and look elsewhere, don't spend your money on this problematic camera.

Nikon COOLPIX L120 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 21x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LCD	16-JUL-14	1	Blurry, blurry, blurry.  Heed the warnings	Ok.  I've had this for 3 years solid.  3 of us in my family use it almost daily so I can finally give an honest review.  You will almost certainly get blurry pictures no matter what you try.  The build and mechanics seem solid. and that's the only thing I can say positive.. If you are taking a picture of a STATIONARY object, with full daylight, outside, using a tripod, holding your breath, saying a prayer, and skipping the morning coffee so your hand doesn't have the slightest shake as you depress the button to take a picture. well shoot, then this camera is PERFECT for you.. However,. If you have children, pets, children in sports, fish, flowers that blow in the breeze, or family and friends that are still alive and breathing. well heck, this camera isn't for you.. Yes, you can play with all the settings all day long. sounds wonderful.  Not for me.  Good luck all.
Nikon COOLPIX L120 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 21x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LCD	26-JUL-14	5	Great Camera!	I've had this camera for three years and it's my favorite. It takes beautiful photos -- and I'm not one who wants to fiddle with the camera by changing settings, etc. It is a little heavy so two years ago I bought a Canon Powershot SX 260 HS which was well reviewed (one site named it travel camera of the year). The Canon is smaller and lighter, but I prefer the Nikon for the most part. I've taken this on at least four overseas trips and just love the photos. I would definitely recommend this Nikon.

Purchased primarily to take photos at concerts. At times photos turn out dark and adjustment of settings is limited to be able to correct the problem. Also has trouble focusing on subjects quickly to capture sudden action shots. Other than its flaws it is a decent camera and I'm still able to get some amazing shots with it, but I'd still like to find something better.

Vividia 8mm USB Flexible Inspection Camera Borescope Endoscope	28-JUL-14	4	Great buy for occational use.	The software does not work for a Mac, but by using "Photobooth", you can use it just fine.  I was able to worm it into a hole in my wall to identify damage that I would not have known about without tearing a large section of the wall out.  Glad I went with this, instead of buying an expensive dedicated unit for my basic uses.

Was able to see what I was looking for but I wish the illumination was brighter. In a dark area, there is a narrow band where you are far enough away for focus yet close enough for brightness.

GE 16MP Digital Camera with 15X Optical Zoom and 2.7 Inch LCD with Auto Brightness	26-JUL-14	4	Not a bad camera	So, I bought this camera to be a backup to my Nikon for a safari to Tanzania . Good thing I had it as carry on since my suitcase with the larger camera did not show up for 4 days.. The pictures it took were good, unless the object was moving. Once you click the shutter release it takes some time before the actual picture is taken but then the animal had moved and all you would see is the butt end of the animal.. Even under sports mode the same problem occurred. If the object was still, the pictures came out well. Also, under the super zoom mode the camera was very difficult to hold steady.. So here is my final recommendation. Great camera for basic daily use.. Not recommended for moving objects especially  if close by.. If you are going on a safari then get a real camera (Nikon, Canon etc) with at least a 400 or 500 mm zoom. At times my 300 zoom lens was inadequate.. Contact me for further Safari advice

The camera we received has a defective cable connector, and we cannot download the pictures in the camera.. Because the camera did not come with a computer cable, we did not discover this problem until after we bought an X500 computer cable, and found that the connector in the camera is defective, making the camera worthless!

Canon Powershot A1200 Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom	09-AUG-14	5	Happily, I found the Canon Powershot	Many of my pictures are taken outdoors. The sun is typically too bright to see what I'm shooting on the LCD screen, which made me hunt for a camera with an optical viewfinder. seemingly a rarity in the newer, affordable point and shoot cameras. Happily, I found the Canon Powershot, a great camera for the non-pros, who simply want great pictures of their outdoor adventures for a reasonable price. I highly recommend this camera for this purpose.
Canon Powershot A1200 Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom	09-AUG-14	3	Doesn't seem to have a very good lens. Also	Doesn't seem to have a very good lens.  Also, too many bells and whistles, too complicated.  Wanted a small, high quality, non SLR camera but they don't make them anymore.  This is about the equivalent of having a bad camera in your phone, or worse.  I got it because it has a view finder but the view finder is so small it's almost useless.  This camera might be okay for casual snapshots but the color will usually come out wrong, the sides with be distorted, and you can't figure out what to do.  Avoid.

Samsung Digital Camera with 14 MP and 10x Optical Zoom	15-JUL-14	5	Great zoom range.	Great camera with long range zooming capabilities. On one battery you should be able to get around 150-200 pictures, so you should probably carry a spare or two. Recently tested out the zoom range at the San Francisco Giants game.  I was sitting literally at the highest part of the upper deck well from the home plate, and still got a clear picture of the batter on the diamond back.  Although you get can only get 14mp at 10x, it's still capable of zooming up to 20x at 3mp.  You can also use it as a camcorder to record video's at 720p and still use the zoom capabilities. It will drain your battery pretty quick on camcorder though.  This is a very good point and shoot camera.

It does not work when I tried to use it at my niece Madeline Hope Ringewald's Crew competition in Florida and I really wanted my own pictures of her crossing the Finish Line. I still don't see the reimbursement that a person by the name of Brian told me would be back on my Chase Morgan Visa card.
Fujifilm FinePix XP10 12 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)	14-JUL-14	1	Don't count on the Fiji FinePix when you need it underwater	I had a planned trip for the Galapagos in May 2014 and already had a Panasonic Lumix waterproof camera.. However, when my traveling companion purchased this Fiji from Sam's Club, i went to the local gym to try both cameras out.. I thought the FinePix was superior to my Panasonic.  I ordered 2 Fiji FinePixs through amazon, one for my daughter in another state.  I did not have time to try mine out before my trip to Galapagos.. Alas, my Fiji had a lens that fogged, and yes, then thought photos are blurred.  The LCD stayed unreadable!  So I took pictures underwater "blind."  maybe a total of 5 of my photos were o.k.  (Only o.k. if lens not fogged.)  The camera instructions even said the lens could fog!!!  Fiji should recall this camera!. There were 16 guests on my boat in the Galapagos.  4, including me, had this Fiji camera.  Mine was the only one to function poorly, so that's only a 75% chance yours will work when you need it.. To my great surprise, my daughter's and my Fiji FinePix came from 2 different amazon suppliers.  And they did not come with a sanDisc, carrying case, etc.  The Fiji model from Sam's was cheaper, and had a "real" instruction book, and extras.. My friend took beautiful underwater pictures with her Fiji.  It is a shame that not all of these cameras work correctly.

Kodak Easyshare C1505 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Digital Zoom - Black	03-AUG-14	5	glad i bought it. great little cheep-o camera!	great little camera.  i saw lots of people complaining about the lack of a memory card.  saw some people giving it low stars because of it. but it States it doesnt come with one.  most people have had a camera already, and there for would most likly have a SD card already, i just took my old one and poped it in.  i have a higher quality camera, but i wanted something that wasnt bulky and could easily fit in a pocket.  this takes really good pictures for the price.  im no pro-picture taker, but the quality is about the same as my expensive one.  i have a feeling ill be using the kodak one a lot more than my other camera.. i also like the share button. just select the pics u want, and it will send them to where u want when u plug it in to the pc. sure is easy!. im not sure yet. but i dont hear any sound with the record video, when i play it back.  it could just be that this cheep-o doesnt have a speaker. it DOES have a mic tho. so im assuming thats the case.  will post update when i remember to. prolly just a way to keep the cost down.. over all im very happy with this camera. i WOULD suggest it to anyone.. easy. simple. pocket friendly.. couldnt have picked a better b-day gift with my amazon gift card!

Kodak EasyShare Z990 12.0 MP Digital Camera with 30x Optical Zoom, HD Video and 3.0-Inch LCD	20-JUL-14	2	I would not recommend this to my enemy.	Not very happy with the camera. I've had it 2 years, and it's pretty much on it's way out.. The battery life is terrible (I've tried several rechargeable AA Batteries, all are awful.). It takes AA Batteries! What are we, 10 years in the past??. The delay between taking shots is too long. The focus sucks. I could go on for days on how bad this camera is.. I give it 2 stars only because the maco and super macro shots were impressive, but again, the lag between shots is just atrocious.. Now that it has aged, it has not aged well.. It will only save about half of the pictures I take (Tried several SD cards, no luck), it wont let me review my photos on the camera, only on the PC, battery life has progressively gotten worse, the interface freezes and has to be reset, it's just a pain in the neck.. Not a fan. Kodak apparently just is not the company they used to be in the camera world.
